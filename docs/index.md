## Introduction

### Project Overview

Horizon Protocol is a DeFi platform that facilitates the on-chain trading of synthetic assets that represent the real economy. Horizon Protocol seeks to provide exposure to real-world assets risk/return profiles via smart contracts on the blockchain.

Forked from Synthetix, Horizon Protocol will leverage the time-tested derivative liquidity protocol and bring interoperability, scalability and a whole new array of tradable, real-world derivative products to the DeFi ecosystem. Our commitment to the Binance ecosystem and native implementation on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offer users the speed and dependability that is currently lacking on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Staking Overview

### Intro

HZN holders can stake their tokens on Horizon Genesis. There are two benefits:

**Staking rewards:**

The system provides rewards for staking. When you stake HZN, your stake is then pooled with all other staked HZN, and collateralizes all synthetic assets (zAssets) on the entire Horizon Protocol network. Staking rewards are distributed per system rules (these can change as the system evolves) and are provided by the token’s inflationary policy, exchange fees, and any other system incentives (if applicable).

**Minting zUSD:**

As an investor, you can mint zUSD, which means you are incurring a debt to the network. The debt must be adequately collateralized, and your collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) always maintained. Further details on maintaining your C-Ratio is provided below.

With zUSD, you can begin trading for other synthetic assets (zAssets). Horizon Exchange will offer cross-chain crypto derivatives, as well as traditional financial markets, such as equities, commodities, and market indices.

### Risk of staking

Staking on Horizon Protocol is not risk free. However, there are strategies to reduce the amount of risk you face in the strategy section below.

By staking, a staker provides the collateral for traders to trade zAssets (synthetic assets). When traders are profitable, stakers incur a loss. When traders are unprofitable, stakers gain. In the early stage of growth, the Horizon Protocol inflation policy provides a balance and incentive to HZN stakers to some extent, however this can change at any point.

Read on in the strategy section for more details on how to approach staking HZN and the best approach that fits you.

**Who can stake?**

Anyone that holds HZN tokens can stake on the network as there is no minimum. However, you must also have BNB tokens to pay for network gas.

## Staking HZN

### Basic Steps

1. Horizon Genesis operates on Binance Smart Chain, so have your HZN token in a compatible wallet. Horizon Genesis supports the following:
	- MetaMask
	- TrustWallet
	- Binance Chain Wallet extension (FireFox, Chrome, Edge)
	- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) are not supported natively by Horizon Protocol, however, are available 		through MetaMask and the Binance Chain Wallet extension.

2. Visit the [Horizon Genesis Website](https://genesis.horizonprotocol.com)

3. Select Mint
	- Choose your minting strategy (select one of the preset strategies, or select the zUSD amount you want to mint).
	- Max. Mint will populate the max amount of zUSD you can mint, given your HZN holdings.

### Mechanics

The minimum collaterization ratio (C-Ratio), USD value of HZN staked divided by USD value of zAssets, you can mint at is 800%. Minting the maximum amount on HZN holdings worth $800 will result in $100 of minted zUSD. For the network to remain secure and fully collateralized, the community has settled on a conservative C-Ratio. However, the ratio could change in the future.

If the HZN token price increases, the system will automatically unstake the additional HZN value to maintain your original C-Ratio and you can mint additional zUSD.  

If the HZN token price decreases, you must ensure you are maintaining a proper C-Ratio. There are a few things to always keep in mind:
- Min. C-Ratio for claiming rewards. If your C-Ratio falls below 800%, you cannot claim rewards – however, they still accrue on your account. You must bring your C-Ratio back over 800% to claim.
- Liquidation risk – if your C-Ratio falls below 200% and remains below 500% for three days you face liquidation from other traders who are willing to fix your C-Ratio at a discount.

## Claiming Rewards

### Maintaining your C-Ratio

Minting Example: You’ve staked $800 worth of HZN, and the system has a target C-Ratio of 800%. The max amount you can mint is $100 zUSD. The C-Ratio can change as per system governance.

**What affects your C-Ratio?**

HZN Market Price:
- If the market price of HZN increases, your C-Ratio will stay the same but the HZN you need to collateralize your position will reduce. You have the option to re-stake the extra HZN.
- If the market price of HZN decreases, your C-Ratio will decrease.

There are two ways to maintain your C-ratio:
- Burn some zUSD. This pays back some or all of your debt and will increase your C-Ratio.
- Stake more HZN. This provides more collateral and will increase your C-Ratio.

### Summary

- Users must maintain a C-Ratio of above 800% in order to be eligible for rewards. (If you are within 1% of 800%, i.e. 792% or above, you’ll be able to claim.) If not, you'll have to buy more HZN or burn zUSD to restore your C-Ratio. This C-Ratio is subject to change based on community governance decisions.
- Rewards are calculated and made available once per week on Fridays.
- Use the [Horizon Genesis Website](https://genesis.horizonprotocol.com/) to navigate to the Claim section.
- Press Claim Now to collect both your zUSD and HZN weekly rewards.
- Claimed HZN rewards are escrowed for 1 year. You won't be able to transfer or sell them. You’ll be able to re-stake them, however. This time of escrow can be changed based on community governance.

### Managing Debt

Your C-Ratio fluctuates based on price changes, whether that be HZN prices in Horizon Genesis initially and extending to synthetic assets when they are incorporated in Horizon Exchange. Basically, the global debt, and your proportion of it will increase if traders are profitable (i.e. synthetic assets increase) and decrease if they are unprofitable (i.e. synthetic assets decrease).

As of Horizon Genesis, the only synthetic asset is zUSD, therefore, the only variable everyone faces in the system is the movement of HZN prices. E.g. I mint $100 of zUSD with $800 of HZN at a 800% collateralization ratio. HZN price drops 50% - my C-Ratio is now 400%. I have to burn $50 of zUSD in order to repay my debt to the system (Or stake an extra $400 HZN) and I can withdraw my initial HZN stake, which is now down 50% due to price change. There is no extra loss I face at this point in time.

In the future, with a multitude of synthetic assets in the system - a common strategy to stabilize a staking position and reduce risk is to ‘go with the flow’. If you merely wish to benefit from the staking rewards whilst reducing the risk of losing when traders are profitable - you can mirror the position the bulk of traders in Horizon Protocol take. If synthetic assets are profitable, your debt will increase; however, the value of the zAssets make up for the debt increase i.e. you won’t have lost whilst receiving staking rewards.

It is fundamental to understand that when other zAssets join zUSD in the synthetic asset lineup that if you were to merely stake HZN as collateral, you are shorting the global portfolio. There is nothing wrong with this approach, you merely must be aware of it. Let’s take an example:

![img](/images/manage-debt.png)

Scenario:

1. John and Adam both mint $100k zUSD. The total network debt is $200k, with John and Adam responsible for 50%.
1. John buys zBNB with his $100k and Adam holds zUSD.
1. In this example, BNB increases by 50% increasing John's holdings to $150k. This price fluctuation increases the total debt to $250k.
1. John and Adam are still responsible for 50% of the total debt each. This means John and Adam both owe $125k. When John's zBNB is taken into consideration, he has profited $25k. Even though Adam still has the same zUSD position size of $100k - the debt he owes increased by 25% resulting in a $25k loss.

**How are HZN stakers rewards calculated?**

There are two components to rewards: zUSD and HZN.

- There will be a transaction fee (in zUSD) on Horizon Exchange of 0.3% that is distributed proportionally to all stakers i.e. the more zUSD you have minted, the higher proportion of fees you will receive.
- HZN rewards are determined by the [Horizon Protocol inflation policy](https://horizonprotocol.medium.com/horizon-supply-and-inflation-policy-f0aaa8cc4a3a). This starts with Horizon Genesis and will begin with 100% of weekly inflation allocated to staking rewards.

You need to be above the target C-Ratio in order to be eligible and claim your rewards. There is no negative consequence to being below the target C-Ratio - you just won’t be able to claim your rewards.

## Strategies

With the target C-Ratio and fluctuating prices, there are a variety of approaches to staking HZN.

There is a liquidation risk to consider: your HZN stake is at risk if your C-Ratio has gone below 200% and stayed below 500% for more than three days. There is a grace period to prevent malicious attacks and provide adequate time to restore your C-Ratio. These variables are subject to change based on community governance decisions.

### Conservative Strategy

A conservative strategy aims to stake HZN and mint zUSD at slightly above the target C-Ratio in order to remain comfortably within the range of being able to claim rewards. It also mimics the global zAsset portfolio (inapplicable with Horizon Genesis) in order to reduce the risk of their global debt increasing due to other synthetic assets going up. If your C-Ratio increases too much - you can mint more zUSD to return to a manageable level.

### Neutral Strategy

A neutral strategy is similar to the conservative strategy insofar that the neutral staker targets an initial C-Ratio just above the target C-Ratio. If the value of HZN increases and their C-Ratio moves up - the neutral staker would mint more zUSD to restore a ratio within their target range in order to maximize staking rewards from transaction fees and the Horizon Protocol inflation policy. The neutral staker would aim to copy the global synthetic portfolio on Horizon Protocol to reduce risk.

### Aggressive Strategy

An aggressive staker stays as close to the target C-Ratio as possible and mints as much zUSD as possible. If HZN value decreases, the aggressive staker might require extra HZN in order to restore their C-Ratio to be eligible to claim rewards. They can, of course, also burn zUSD in order to bring their C-Ratio back up. They would use their zUSD in how they perceive the market not copy the global portfolio to reduce risk.

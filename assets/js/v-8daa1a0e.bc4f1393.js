Synthetic assets can be stocks, tokens, indices, NFTs, or other financial products and are produced to mimic the original asset, typically in the form of its price. For example, a synthetic asset of a stock would mimic the price fluctuations of the stock, while a synthetic asset of a token would mimic the price fluctuations of the token. Since synthetic assets are also tokenized, they are easily accessible and allow for an additional layer of DeFi products that can be applied to the asset, possibly giving yield-generating opportunities to investors on assets that may not have had these options naturally.</p><h3 id="zassets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zassets" aria-hidden="true">#</a> zAssets</h3><p>Synthetic Assets produced on Horizon Protocol are called zAssets. For example, a Gamestop (GME) stock would be called zGME.</p><h3 id="zusd" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#zusd" aria-hidden="true">#</a> zUSD</h3><p>zUSD is the core zAsset of Horizon Protocol and is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. zUSD is important because the total value of all the synthetic assets (global debt) produced on Horizon Protocol is evaluated and denominated in zUSD.</p><p>Horizon Genesis will guarantee that zUSD is valued at $1.00 when being <a href="#mint">minted</a> or <a href="#burn">burned</a>. The value of zUSD that exists on the open market could fluctuate in price (based on supply/demand forces), but that would create arbitrage opportunities to profit between the open market and Horizon Genesis.</p><p>zUSD will also facilitate the trading of other zAssets, which will be available on the Horizon Exchange (under development).</p><p>Horizon Exchange will offer cross-chain crypto derivatives, traditional asset derivatives, as well as new financial products/assets.</p><h3 id="collateralization-ratio-c-ratio" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#collateralization-ratio-c-ratio" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Collateralization Ratio (C-Ratio)</h3><p>All zAssets produced on Horizon Protocol must be collateralized by HZN in order for their values to be maintained. HZN is staked and zUSD is minted at a Collateralization Ratio (C-Ratio) of 800% ($8 worth of HZN to mint $1 zUSD), and this C-Ratio must be maintained in order to collect rewards from the system. The purpose of the C-Ratio is to ensure that the synthetic assets are sufficiently backed during HZN price fluctuations. The 800% target C-Ratio is subject to change based on the community governance.</p><h3 id="staking-and-rewards" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#staking-and-rewards" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Staking and Rewards</h3><p>There are multiple ways to stake on Horizon Genesis and earn rewards. There are two ways to stake: <strong>Mint</strong> and <strong>Earn</strong>. <strong>Mint</strong> is when a user creates zUSD using HZN as collateral and gets rewards according to the amount of debt they hold. This will be the main way to stake and will also receive the majority of the rewards issued in Horizon Protocol. <strong>Earn</strong> provides different opportunities to earn through liquidity provision and the staking of LP tokens.</p><p>Staking rewards are distributed per system rules (these can change as the system evolves) and are provided by the token’s inflationary policy, exchange fees (relevant when the Horizon Exchange becomes available), and any other system incentives (if applicable).</p><h3 id="debt" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#debt" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Debt</h3><p>Debt is an important concept for understanding reward distribution when minting on Horizon Genesis. When a user mints zUSD, they are borrowing zUSD with HZN as collateral, and they will have to return (burn) their zUSD in order to reclaim their HZN. That means that they are now in debt (interest-free) to the amount of the zUSD that they have minted. User rewards are calculated weekly by the ratio of the user&#39;s debt relative to the global debt in the Horizon Protocol network.

As an investor, you can mint zUSD, which means you are incurring an interest-free debt to the network. The debt must be adequately collateralized and your C-Ratio always maintained in order to be eligible for rewards. For savvy investors, this debt can be leveraged to earn yield through staking as an LP or trading on the Horizon Exchange.</p><p>Anyone that holds HZN tokens can stake on the network, with no minimum requirements.

The global debt will increase if traders are profitable (i.e. synthetic asset values increase) and decrease if they are unprofitable (i.e. synthetic asset values decrease).</p><p>As of Horizon Genesis, the only synthetic asset is zUSD, therefore, the only variable everyone faces in the system is the movement of HZN prices. E.g. I mint $100 of zUSD with $800 of HZN at a 800% collateralization ratio. HZN price drops 50% - my C-Ratio is now 400%. I have to burn $50 of zUSD in order to repay my debt to the system (Or stake an extra $400 HZN) and I can withdraw my initial HZN stake, which is now down 50% due to price change. There is no extra loss I face at this point in time.</p><p>In the future when a range of other synthetic assets are introduced to the system, you will need to understand that your debt obligation to the system is proportionally based, meaning the system tracks the percentage of your debt relative to the global debt. Because of this, when the prices of the assets in the global debt portfolio change, so does your debt obligation. If you are 1% of the global debt with $1000 in debt, and the average price of all assets in the global portfolio increases by 10% (which also means the global debt is increased by 10%), then your debt obligation will also increase and become $1100. If the synthetic assets you hold do not also increase by 10%, then you will incur a loss (assuming the global debt doesn&#39;t shrink back later).</p><p>Lets take an example:</p><p><img src="/images/hzn-docs-debt.png" alt="img"></p><p>Scenario:</p><ol><li>John and Adam both mint $100k zUSD. The total network debt is $200k, with John and Adam responsible for 50%.</li><li>John buys zBNB with his $100k and Adam holds zUSD.</li><li>In this example, BNB increases by 50% increasing John&#39;s holdings to $150k. This price fluctuation increases the total debt to $250k.</li><li>John and Adam are still responsible for 50% of the total debt each. This means John and Adam both owe $125k. When John&#39;s zBNB is taken into consideration, he has profited $25k. Even though Adam still has the same zUSD position size of $100k - the debt he owes increased by 25% resulting in a $25k loss.</li></ol><p>To mitigate this risk, you can either try to mirror the global portfolio, or you can hedge your position by holding some inverse assets (synthetic assets that directly short the market) to offset the volatility in both directions (long and short).</p><p>It is fundamental to understand that when other zAssets join zUSD in the synthetic asset lineup that if you were to merely stake HZN as collateral and just hold your minted zUSD, you are effectively shorting the global portfolio if that portfolio consisted of appreciating synthetic assets.</p><h3 id="how-are-horizon-genesis-rewards-calculated" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-horizon-genesis-rewards-calculated" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How are Horizon Genesis rewards calculated?</h3><p>There are two components to rewards: HZN and zUSD.</p>',32),aa=(0,o.Uk)("HZN rewards are determined by the "),ta={href:"https://horizonprotocol.medium.com/horizon-supply-and-inflation-policy-f0aaa8cc4a3a",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},oa=(0,o.Uk)("Horizon Protocol inflation policy"),ra=(0,o.Uk)(".

This higher C-Ratio (and lower risk) comes at a cost of less zUSD being minted and therefore less rewards. This strategy is better for users who can&#39;t check in to manage their positions as frequently and give themselves are larger buffer against the volatility of HZN. An even more conservative ratio of greater than 1200% can be maintained as well if the user wants to further de-risk their debt position.</p><h4 id="neutral-strategy-moderate-risk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#neutral-strategy-moderate-risk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Neutral Strategy (Moderate Risk)</h4><p>A neutral strategy aims to be a middle ground between the conservative and aggressive strategy at 1000% C-Ratio.

This is high risk due to the fact that if the price of HZN decreases at all from the point where they minted zUSD, the staker cannot claim any rewards. This strategy requires very active management to maintain their C-Ratio in order to collect rewards and prevent liquidation as the buffer zone to liquidation is much lower than the conservative and neutral strategies.</p><h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FAQ</h2><h3 id="staking" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#staking" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Staking</h3><h4 id="how-do-i-stake-my-hzn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-stake-my-hzn" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I stake my HZN?</h4><p>To stake HZN you also need to mint zUSD, which is a stablecoin backed by your staked HZN.

If you do not claim your rewards after a week, your rewards will be forfeited and redistributed to the following week&#39;s reward pool.</p><h4 id="how-do-i-know-how-much-zusd-to-burn-in-order-to-rebalance-my-c-ratio-to-800" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-know-how-much-zusd-to-burn-in-order-to-rebalance-my-c-ratio-to-800" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I know how much zUSD to burn in order to rebalance my C-Ratio to 800%?</h4><p>Horizon Genesis has preset strategies to help you manage your C-Ratio. Simply clicking the “Aggressive - 800%” preset strategy will automatically calculate how much zUSD you need to burn to return to 800%. You may also manually input how much zUSD you want to burn if you want to maintain a different C-Ratio.</p><h4 id="when-exactly-am-i-in-the-liquidation-zone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-exactly-am-i-in-the-liquidation-zone" aria-hidden="true">#</a> When exactly am I in the liquidation zone?</h4><p>If your C-Ratio goes under 200% - you will be automatically flagged for liquidation. Horizon Genesis has a 3-day grace period to allow you to restore your C-Ratio and clear your liquidation flag before your account becomes available for liquidation. You will need to restore your C-Ratio back to 800% before you&#39;re able to clear your liquidation flag.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">WARNING</p><p>Please note that clearing your liquidation flag requires a blockchain transaction and is NOT automatic.</p></div><p>Learn more about liquidation <a href="#liquidation">here</a>.</p><h4 id="when-i-burn-zusd-do-i-also-burn-my-hzn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-i-burn-zusd-do-i-also-burn-my-hzn" aria-hidden="true">#</a> When I burn zUSD, do I also burn my HZN?</h4><p>No, you never lose HZN when burning zUSD. If your C-Ratio is under 800%, burning zUSD just reduces your debt and increases your C-Ratio. Once your C-Ratio is above 800% you will begin to unstake your HZN when burning zUSD. Reducing your debt to 0 would unstake all of your HZN.
